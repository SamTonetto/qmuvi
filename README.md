Quantum computing is notorious for being unintuitive and difficult to imagine. This python module attempts to create some kind of connection between a human observer and the complex workings of quantum computation by transforming quantum algorithms into music videos. 

This is a python library that can be included into your qiskit project and used to convert your quantum circuits into music video files (in .mp4 format). Add a barrier to a quantum circuit for each time step to sample the quantum state for, then call the _make_music_video_ or _make_music_midi_ methods. This will create a folder with all of the generated content inside it.

# Mapping quantum to music

A quantum density matrix simulator is used to sample mixed states (a probabilistic mixture of pure states) at various time steps.

Each pure state is a state vector representing a superposition of computational basis states. A state with no noise is a pure state and so will only have a single non-zero term in the probabilistic mixture. As incoherent noise is introduced, more terms with non-zero probability will appear. The superposition of states in a pure state will determine the notes that are played. The mapping from integer representation of the state to note number can be customised by passing in a method that takes an int and returns an int (60 is middle C), this allows the possibility to map states to notes of musical scales. 

A list of instrument collections (see example below) can be specified to assign, in order of decreasing probability, instrument collections to the pure states of the mixture (the instrument collection list can be manually specified in the method call). A maximum of 8 instrument collections can be specified (if there are less than 8, the remaining pure states will use the last instrument collection in the list). The instrument for each note is chosen from the collection by the state's phase angle in the superposition. The angles are discretised to match the size of the collection, where an angle of zero corresponds to the first instrument. 

The velocity (which is proportional to volume) of each note is calculated by multiplying the propability of the pure state in the mixture and the probability of the computational basis state of the pure state's superposition, normalised such that there is always a note with velocity equal to 1.  

# Example:
```
import quantum_music
from quantum_music import make_music_midi, make_music_video, get_instruments, chromatic_middle_c
import qiskit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

circ = QuantumCircuit(4)
circ.h(0)
circ.barrier() # signals to the quantum music transpiler to sample the state at this time step
circ.cx(0, 1)
circ.barrier()
circ.cx(1, 2)
circ.barrier()
circ.cx(2, 3)
circ.barrier()
circ.h(3)
circ.barrier()
circ.cx(3,2)
circ.barrier()
circ.cx(2,1)
circ.barrier()
circ.cx(1,0)
circ.barrier()
rhythm = [(120, 60)]*8 # sound length and rest time for each sample
single_qubit_error = 0.02
two_qubit_error = 0.05

                    
intruments = []
intruments.append([73]) # a pipe
intruments.append(get_instruments('tuned_perc'))

# Converts the circuit to music and outputs it as a midi file
make_music_midi(circ, "my_quantum_midi", rhythm, single_qubit_error, two_qubit_error, intruments, note_map=chromatic_middle_c)

# Converts the circuit to music and video and outputs the result as an mp4 file
make_music_video(circ, "my_quantum_video", rhythm, single_qubit_error, two_qubit_error, intruments, note_map=chromatic_middle_c)
```

Run the python script and it should output all the content into a folder with the specified name (e.g. "my_quantum_video").  
**Warning:** Using numbers in the name sometimes causes an error.

# Setup
This project uses Python 3. Download the repo and use the example .py files as a starting point.
  
## Convert to midi:
Python packages: qiskit==0.37.0, and mido==1.2.10 (and some other common packages like numpy). Earlier versions will probably work too.

## Convert to mp3:
Install VLC player and add its install path to the PATH system variable. 

VLC needs to be configured to use a sound font (.sf2 file). If VLC can play a midi file successfully then it is already configured. There is one located in the folder "GeneralUser GS 1.471" (this will likely be removed from the repo later), however you can use whichever modern SoundFont you like. Go to VLC preferences (show all settings) -> Input/Codecs -> Audio codecs -> (FluidSynth or whatever MAC version uses) -> Browse to SoundFont location.  

#### Mac OS
Instead of adding the install directory to PATH, you can instead create a symlink of VLC in the usr/local/bin/ directory (or some other directory already in the PATH environment variable) with the following command.

```ln -s Application/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC usr/local/bin/```

Note: if you haven't done this before you may need to create the usr/local/bin/ directory first.

## Convert to video:
Python packages: qiskit==0.37.0, moviepy==1.0.3, mido==1.2.10, and matplotlib==3.5.2 (and some other common packages like numpy). Earlier versions will probably work too.

#### Mac OS
The ffmpeg codec for video processing may not be installed after installing MoviePy. If so, install it manually using your package manager. E.g.

```brew install ffmpeg```
